file_updater
============

Bash-based file updater intended for web servers.

The file updater uses sftp by default, but an option can be given to use ftp also. To use this, you run the update.sh file. When using this you can either use the configuration file by specifying it as an argument, or run without giving a file and allowing the script to prompt you about all the information.
